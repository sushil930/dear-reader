            This is not a blog. This is not a magazine. This is a diaryâ€”one that exists 
            in the liminal space between private thoughts and shared understanding.

          <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4">
            Here, we explore the psychology of being human: the weight of overthinking, 
            the beauty of emotional awareness, and the gentle art of self-reflection. 
            These are the thoughts that visit us at 2 AM, the observations we make in 
            quiet moments, the patterns we notice in our minds.
